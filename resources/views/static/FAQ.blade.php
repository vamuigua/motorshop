        <h5><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> How quickly should I take my car to the garage in when the check engine light comes on ?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>When your check engine light comes on, it's your vehicle's way of telling you something isn't right.  It is the same thing that happens to us when we get a cold.  You feel tired but don't know why you feel this way, because your nose hasn't started running and you aren't coughing.  You're body is giving you the first signal that you are sick.  Your check engine light is your vehicle's signal that it's time for a check up before it turns into a coughing, sputtering mess. 
           Once you notice your check engine light is on, don't panic, but know it is time to take your vehicle in to your local automotive repair professional for an inspection.</p>

        <h5><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> How often should I change my oil and why ?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>The consensus agrees that a driver should get an oil change every 3,000 to 7,000 miles or every three months. However, you can always refer to your owner's manual which covers the recommended oil change interval for your specific make and model.
           Many of today's newer vehicles will actually tell you when they are due for service. Remember: an oil change is essential because it acts as a lubricant for the internal cogs and gears under the hood. Without it, oil can turn into sludge and prohibit your vehicle from operating correctly.</p>

        <h5><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Is it important to have a mechanic inspect a used car before I buy it ?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>We can't stress enough how important a pre-sale vehicle inspection is.  This is the only sure fire way of knowing what you are really purchasing, because even 'pretty' vehicles can have an ugly unsafe side to them.  With our used car inspection, we look for safety concerns and look for overall maintenance issues. 
           We also review the vehicle for body damage that the seller may be trying to hide.  Having a professional technician inspect your car gives you a very clear picture of the 'true' condition the car is in and in some cases gives you the power to negotiate a better price.</p>

        <h5><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> What do I do if my vehicle starts to over heat ?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Once you notice your vehicles temperature is starting to climb, it is best to take immediate action.  First thing you should do is turn off your AC if you have it on and find a safe place to pull your car off the road.  Do NOT attempt to remove the radiator cap or check any of the hoses. 
           It is very dangerous to do this under these conditions, and you are likely to get severely burned.  A car that has over heated can cause massive damage, very quickly.  This is why it is important to pull off the road as soon as you safely can and have your vehicle towed to our shop for an inspection.</p>

        <h5><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> How do I know if my battery is in good working condition ?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>The Kenyan &#x1F1F0;&#x1F1EA; heat can be very hard on car batteries.  A couple indicators that your battery may be starting to fail are the clock in your vehicle has been reset or isn't keeping correct time or your radio stations are no longer programmed.
            You may also notice your car is slower than usual to crank over when you start it.</p>

        <h5><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Do I need to check the coolant in my vehicle and does it need to be replaced ever ?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>It is a good idea to check your coolant and engine oil at least 1 to 2 times a month to make sure the fluid looks good and is filled to the appropriate level.  Every manufacture will have suggested maintenance schedule for replacing your cars fluids. 
           In most cases, we suggest you change your coolant every 30,000 miles.  If you are unsure whether it is time to have your coolant replaced, stop by with your car, and we can help you determine if a coolant change is needed.</p>

        <h5><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> How Often Should I Check My Vehicle's Fluid Levels ?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Aside from engine oil, there are many other fluids that are vital to the health of your vehicle.
           Some examples include the transmission fluid, brake fluid, engine coolant, and power-steering fluid. Their levels are not only affected by how frequently you drive but extreme temperatures as well. As such, specialists advise checking them at the same time as your oil change or every month or two.</p>

        <h5><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> When Should I Replace My Brake Pads ?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>On average, brake pads begin to wear out around the 32,186- to 43,280-kilometers mark, but there are many factors that may impact this figure.
           Knowing what signs to look out for will therefore prove instrumental in detecting when your brake pads need to be replaced. If you feel your vehicle taking longer to come to a stop or notice a high-pitch screeching or grinding noise when braking, scheduling a checkup is integral. Running with worn brake pads will eventually affect the rotors, which can be a costly repair, so taking a proactive approach will not only keep you safe but save you money as well.</p>
